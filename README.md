# Quantify fluorescent dot expression 
Demonstration of how to analyze the total fluorescent dot expression of the delineated green fluorescent Oprk1 dot images.
- We have created a custom MATLAB scrip to analyse fluorescent dot expression images automatically

Our paper is not published yet, but when using the code you can cite: Krogsbaek M, Larsen NY, Landau A, Sanchez C, Lin J and Nyengaard JR. "Spatial quantification of single cell mRNA and ligand binding of the kappa opioid receptor in rat hypothalamus".
